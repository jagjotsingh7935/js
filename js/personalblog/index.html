            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hello! My name is Jagjot Singh, and I'm currently a student studying Information Technology at the Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College Ludhina. My journey into the world of technology has been an exciting one, and I am particularly passionate about web development and Java programming. <br><br>
                
                <h3>Background</h3>
                As an Information Technology student, I've been exposed to a wide range of subjects that have helped me build a solid foundation in computer science. From databases to network security, I've enjoyed learning about the various aspects of IT. However, my true passion lies in web development and Java programming. <br><br>
                
                <h3>Interests</h3>
                I find web development fascinating because it allows me to create interactive and user-friendly applications that can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. I enjoy every step of the development process, from designing the front-end interfaces to writing efficient back-end code. Here are some of my specific interests:<br><br>
                
                <h4>Front-End Development:</h4>I love creating visually appealing and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm particularly interested in using frameworks like React to build dynamic user interfaces. <br><br>
                Back-End Development: I have a keen interest in server-side programming and have gained experience working with Java. 
                <br> Java has been a key part of my studies, and I appreciate its versatility and robustness. Whether I'm working on web applications or software projects, Java provides the tools I need to build reliable and scalable solutions. <br><br>
               <h4> What I Do</h4>
                In addition to my studies, I spend my free time working on personal projects and contributing to open-source software. I believe that practical experience is crucial, so I often participate in coding challenges and hackathons to sharpen my skills. <br><br>
                
                
                Thank you for visiting my blog! Here, I share my experiences, tutorials, and insights on web development and Java programming. Whether you're a fellow student or someone looking to learn more about these fields, I hope you find my posts informative and inspiring. <br><br>
